# Skill packs

Cybersecurity is one pack. Read the matching router, then open **one**
playbook and follow it. Do not invent the procedure from memory, and do
not flatten a pack into one guess. For the local adapted packs below, the
same rule is strict: choose exactly one child playbook per turn, never two.

On OpenClaw every playbook is a top-level skill in your prompt, named by its
own directory — `code-change-blast-radius-map`, not a path under a pack. The
loader stops at a directory that has a `SKILL.md` and never looks inside it,
so the build lifts each child up to the top before baking. Open a playbook by
that name. The last column below is a repository path for whoever maintains
this repo, not a place to go looking on disk.

Precedence is deterministic. Apply these rules in order:

1. Classify cybersecurity and change-review first. Authorized recon, a hunt,
   or a security report selects `cybersecurity-pack`; a pull request, patch,
   or snippet selects `change-review` after `target-workspace`. Neither
   classification falls through to a broad engineering, product, or marketing
   row. If both a live security probe and a patch are requested, handle them
   as separate turns; each turn still opens only one playbook.
2. An exact named child outcome beats broad category rows. For an agent skill,
   provenance/source/license review wins over generic skill pressure-testing: use
   `agent-skill-provenance-license-review`, not
   `skill-definition-pressure-test`, when the question is source, provenance,
   or license. Architecture decision planning wins over generic engineering architecture:
   use `software-architecture-decision-gate`. Feature-need validation wins over generic product ideation:
   use `feature-necessity-decision`. A bounded 30-day public/community signal wins over generic competitor/research:
   use `thirty-day-cross-source-signal-brief` or
   `community-claim-sentiment-pulse`.
3. If no first-priority classification or exact child outcome matches, use
   the narrowest broad category row below.

After the router selects a pack, open exactly one child playbook for the turn.
Do not combine children or use a router as a second playbook.

If a local adapted pack or router is missing, tell the owner to run
`scripts/install-skill-packs.sh --routers-only` (Windows:
`install-skill-packs.ps1 -RoutersOnly`). If an external pack is missing, run
`scripts/install-skill-packs.sh` (Windows: `install-skill-packs.ps1`). If the
cybersecurity pack is missing, run `scripts/install-skills.sh` (Windows:
`install-skills.ps1`). Do not substitute a cloud workspace for a Latch checkout.

Files the owner keeps go through Latch, under
`~/CatPaw/workspaces/<slug>/` on their computer. Not `/var/lib/plow`.
Not `~/Plow`, unless they asked for the Latch inbox.
