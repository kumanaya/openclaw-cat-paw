Usage: $(basename "$0") [--line NAME] [--new-line]

  --line NAME   Mint this free line by dashboard name (Willow) or uid (ln_p1)
  --new-line    Provision a new assistant line. Requires a phone SMS.
                Do not pass this when a free line already exists.

With no flags, the installer is non-interactive after phone login:
  - skip login when ~/.config/plow/token exists
  - skip mint when plow-credentials exists
  - if the account has no lines yet, create the first one (required)
  - otherwise mint the first free line (no assistant assigned), by name
  - start Docker Compose with AGENT_ID=openclaw-cat-paw

Do not create a second line unless --new-line was passed. If every existing
line is occupied, stop and ask — do not invent another number.
Do not call plow-agents mint or docker compose by hand.
