"""Check the five skills this repository owns.

The 51 shared playbooks live in
https://github.com/kumanaya/cat-paw-workflows and are verified there, at the
commit this image pins. What is left here are the skills that are statements
about THIS agent — the boot, the state directory, how a reply is delivered,
what is baked in this image — and they are the ones a shared repository cannot
hold, because the same text would be false in the other runtime.

So this file is small on purpose. It proves three things:

  1. exactly the five are here, and nothing crept back in
  2. each one is loadable by OpenClaw: a directory named after its frontmatter
  3. each one actually names this runtime, which is the whole reason it is
     local — a skill that stopped saying "OpenClaw" stopped earning its place
